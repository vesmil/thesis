\section{Dependencies}\label{sec:dependencies}

\subsection*{Linux}

On Debian-based Linux systems (such as Ubuntu), you may install these dependencies with APT:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
sudo apt-get install -y \
     clang cmake make g++ \
     fuse libfuse-dev libgtest-dev libsodium-dev \
     pkg-config libboost-program-options-dev
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{macOS}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
brew install --cask macfuse
brew install libsodium
brew install boost
brew install googletest
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Apple Silicon}

Even though supported it is not as easy as on Intel Macs.

You also need to support kernel extensions on M1 Macs as \ldots
Open recovery mode, \ldots

Note: It will prompt you specifically\ldots\

\subsection*{Windows}

\xxx{Do it proerly}

To set up the project on a Windows system, you will need to install the required dependencies and then configure the build system. Follow these steps:

Install MSYS2: Download and run the installer from the official website (\url{https://www.msys2.org/}). This will provide a Unix-like environment on Windows and will be used to install other dependencies.

Open the MSYS2 terminal (either MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit or MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit, depending on your system) and update the package database and core system packages:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
pacman -Syu
\end{lstlisting}

Install the required dependencies using the following command:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
pacman -S
make gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake
mingw-w64-x86_64-fuse3
mingw-w64-x86_64-libsodium
mingw-w64-x86_64-boost
mingw-w64-x86_64-googletest
\end{lstlisting}

Open the MSYS2 terminal in your project directory.

\subsection*{Docker}

Even though there is a functional Docker file, it main purpose was for testing.
Reason behind that being that FUSE requires kernel module and Docker does not add any significant benefits.

\section{Build}\label{sec:build}

Create a build directory and navigate to it:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
mkdir build
cd build
\end{lstlisting}

Configure the project using CMake:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" ..
\end{lstlisting}

Build the project:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
make
\end{lstlisting}
