\section*{Dependencies}\label{sec:dependencies}

Before we even start, we need to clone the repository.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
git clone git@gitlab.mff.cuni.cz:teaching/\
theses/yaghob/vesely-milan/source-code.git
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent \ldots or in case you do not have access to MFF GitLab:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
git clone https://github.com/vesmil/thesis-source
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent After that we need to install the dependencies.

\subsection*{Linux}

On Debian-based Linux systems (such as Ubuntu), you may install these dependencies with apt:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
     clang cmake make g++ fuse libfuse-dev \
     libgtest-dev libsodium-dev \
     pkg-config libboost-program-options-dev
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Other linux distributions may have different package names for the dependencies.
But overall, it should be similar.

\subsubsection*{Docker}\label{subsubsec:docker-guide}

Even though there is a functioning Docker file, its main purpose was for testing.
The Reason behind that is that FUSE requires kernel module, and Docker would have to reuse the host's kernel.

\subsection*{macOS}

For macOS, you have to use Homebrew:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
brew install --cask macfuse && \
brew install libsodium boost googletest cmake llvm
\end{lstlisting}

Even though macs are supported and tested for both Intel and Apple Silicon; the setup does include some extra steps.
Namely, you need to enable support for kernel extensions.
This is done through recovery mode, but I will not go into details as there are multiple guides on the internet on how to do that\cite{macos-kext}.
I may also note that in case you skip this step, the program will prompt you to do so upon running.

Unfortunately, the current implementation of encryption module is not compatible with Apple Silicon.
This is due to the fact that libsodium does not support it yet.
However, the rest of the project should work just fine.

\subsection*{Windows}

The project is not supported on Windows as both WinFSP and Dokany have different API than FUSE\@.
However, it could be easily ported to Windows by providing a different implementation of \texttt{FuseWrapper}.
All the other used libraries should be platform independent.
Nonetheless, it could be theoretically run on Windows using WSL\@.

\section*{Build}\label{sec:build}

Once the environment is set up, you can build the project easily using CMake.
From the root of the repository follow these steps:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
mkdir build
cd build
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Configure the project using CMake:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
cmake ..
make
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Optionally, you can save yourself some typing by adding the executables to your \texttt{PATH} variable or creating aliases such as:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
  alias cvfs_encrypt="path/to/cvfs_encrypt"
  alias cvfs_version="path/to/cvfs_version"
  alias custom_vfs="path/to/customvfs_exec"
\end{lstlisting}
