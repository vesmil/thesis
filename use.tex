\chapter{Usage}

\section*{Mount the file system}

Mounting the file system is rather simple.
All you need to do is a directory and to run the following command:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
  .\customvfs_exec /path/to/mountpoint
\end{lstlisting}

But there are mutliple options you can use.

First of all mounting point does not have to be positional argument and you can use \texttt{-m} or \texttt{-{}-mountpoint} option.

In case you want to use already existing directory in this VFS, you can use the \texttt{-b} or \texttt{-{}-backing} option with specified path to the directory.
Note, that the directory will be altered.

Another optopn you might use is \texttt{-f} or \texttt{-{}-fuse-args} which will pass following argument to the FUSE library.
In case of multiple arguments, do not forget to use quotes.

\subsection*{Example}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
  .\customvfs_exec -b /path/to/backing/directory -m /path/to/mountpoint -f "-o nonempty -f -d"
\end{lstlisting}

This will mount the file system to \texttt{/path/to/mountpoint} with \texttt{/path/to/backing/directory} as backing directory and with \texttt{-o nonempty -f -d} as FUSE arguments.
Meaning it will run in foreground, print debug messages and allow mounting to non-empty directory.

\subsection*{Unmount the file system}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
  fusermount -u /path/to/mountpoint
\end{lstlisting}

Or in case of macOS:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
    umount /path/to/mountpoint
\end{lstlisting}


\section*{Commands}

Now when you are all set up, you can start using the file system.
All standard operations stays the same as you are used to.
Well, that was the whole point of this project.

But to you use the custom features, you need to use the separate tools.
There are two of them, one for each feature.

\subsection*{Encryption}

To encrypt a file or directory, you need to use the \texttt{customvfs\_encrypt} tool.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small]
  .\customvfs_encrypt /path/to/file/or/directory
\end{lstlisting}
