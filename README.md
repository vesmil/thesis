## Introduction

The thesis topic is creating a custom virtual file system (VFS) in C++.

VFS is an intermediate layer between the OS and the underlying storage devices that allows a computer to manipulate files and directories on a storage device in a uniform way, regardless of the actual type of storage device.

I'd like to extend the functionality of a VFS by adding new features that are not commonly found in existing systems. The features on which I would like to focus are encryption (on directory or even file level) and versioning with the possibility to easily add new features later.
