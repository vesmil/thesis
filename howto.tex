\section*{Compilation and setup}

On Debian-based Linux systems (such as Ubuntu), you may install these dependencies with APT:

\xxx{I will just copy-paste it from the final CI/CD script}

\begin{Verbatim}
apt-get install build-essential cmake libfuse-dev crypto++-dev ...
\end{Verbatim}

To unpack and compile the software, proceed as follows:

\begin{Verbatim}
...
cmake ..
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection*{Mount the file system}

Mounting the file system is rather simple.
All you need to do is a directory and to run the following command:

\begin{Verbatim}
  CustomVFS /path/to/mountpoint
\end{Verbatim}

\xxx{mby add notes about options}

\subsection*{Unmount the file system}

\begin{Verbatim}
  fusermount -u /path/to/mountpoint
\end{Verbatim}

\section*{Section}
